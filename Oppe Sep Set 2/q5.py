'''
Find Sum and Absolute Difference Alternately
Given n pairs of integers, print the sum and the absolute difference of each pair alternatively, starting with the sum for the first pair.

NOTE: This is an I/O type question, you need to write the whole code for taking input and printing the output.

Input Format

    • The first line contains an integer n, the number of pairs.

    • The next n lines each contain two comma-separated integers.

Output Format

    • For each pair of integers, print the sum if it is an odd-numbered pair (starting from 1), and the absolute difference if it is an even-numbered pair.

Example

Input

3
1,2
3,5
4,3
Output

3
2
7
Explanation

    1. First pair (1, 2): Sum (1 + 2 = 3)

    2. Second pair (3, 5): Absolute difference (|3 - 5| = 2)

    3. Third pair (4, 3): Sum (4 + 3 = 7)

n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    a,b = input().split(",")
    a = int(a)
    b = int(b)
    
    if i%2==0:
        print(a+b)
    else:
        print (abs(a-b))
